# Piece It Together

> My friend dared me to find the secret password to their website, but their code is so messy! It's impossible to see what's what! Can you help me? [mhsctf-pieceittogether.0xmmalik.repl.co](https://mhsctf-pieceittogether.0xmmalik.repl.co/) (you may need to wait for the site to wake up)

Inspecting the page, there is an array encoded in hex. There is also a function that checks the password.

```JavaScript

var _0xa8fe=["\x34\x77","\x64\x7D","\x67\x7B","\x6A","\x7D","\x31\x67","\x77\x30","\x72","\x61\x6C","\x73","\x68\x37","\x61\x67\x7B","\x66\x6C","\x6D\x33\x74","\x76\x61\x6C\x75\x65","\x70\x77\x64","\x67\x65\x74\x45\x6C\x65\x6D\x65\x6E\x74\x42\x79\x49\x64","\x59\x65\x70\x2C\x20\x74\x68\x61\x74\x27\x73\x20\x74\x68\x65\x20\x66\x6C\x61\x67\x21","\x53\x6F\x72\x72\x79\x2C\x20\x74\x68\x61\x74\x27\x73\x20\x6E\x6F\x74\x20\x74\x68\x65\x20\x66\x6C\x61\x67\x21"];

function checkpwd() {
	if (document[_0xa8fe[16]](_0xa8fe[15])[_0xa8fe[14]] == (_0xa8fe[12]+ _0xa8fe[11]+ _0xa8fe[3]+ _0xa8fe[5]+ _0xa8fe[9]+ _0xa8fe[0]+ _0xa8fe[4])) {
		alert(_0xa8fe[17])
	}
	else {
		alert(_0xa8fe[18])
	}
}
    
```

In console, we can view the contents of the array using `console.log(_0xa8fe)`. Likewise, we can look at the correct password using `console.log((_0xa8fe[12]+ _0xa8fe[11]+ _0xa8fe[3]+ _0xa8fe[5]+ _0xa8fe[9]+ _0xa8fe[0]+ _0xa8fe[4]))`.

The flag is `flag{j1gs4w}`
