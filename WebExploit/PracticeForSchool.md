# Practice for School

> I think it's a great terrible idea to get practice with some exploits you can absolutely should never use on school assignments. Join my Edpuzzle class using the given link and complete the only assignment there (it's called "flag{???????}"). [www.edpuzzle.com/open/disvact](https://edpuzzle.com/open/disvact) Note: the video is 168 hours (1 week) long so you will not be able to watch through the whole thing. :)

[This guy](https://greencoin.life/how-to/skip/edpuzzle/8KP-CmZSm_w) has a way to bypass the fast forward restrictions on EdPuzzle. Right click the bottom left of the video (the YouTube logo), click "inspect" and delete the HTML element that was selected. Right click on the video two times, click "show all options" and drag the seeker element towards the end of the video where the interaction is.

The flag is `flag{th1s_15_a_us3ful_expl0it_f0r_sch00l}`.
