# Erlenmeyer Biscuits (Cuppa Joe 2)

> You remember that coffee shop that just opened up, Cuppa Joe? Well there's now a competitor shop that's opening up across from them! It's called Erlenmeyer Biscuits, and here is their website. I really don't want Cuppa Joe to go out of business, so do you think you could dig up some dirt on Erlenmeyer Biscuits to stop them from opening?
