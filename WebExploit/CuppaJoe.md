# Cuppa Joe

> A new coffee shop is opening up in my neihborhood! It's called Cuppa Joe and I can't wait to check it out! It would ahem be a real shame if someone were to ahem hack their website and, hypothetically, get their secret flag. [mhsctf-cuppajoe.0xmmalik.repl.co](https://mhsctf-cuppajoe.0xmmalik.repl.co/) (you may need to wait for the site to wake up)

There seems to be a page called `flag.php`, however, we cannot access it, but the flag is probably in this file. There is a text box that allows us to make post requests to the server. Experimenting with code injection, PHP tags get commented out, but the site is vulnerable to XSS. We can make a script to help redirect us to the correct page.

```JavaScript
<script>window.location.replace("https://mhsctf-cuppajoe.0xmmalik.repl.co/flag.php");</script>
```

The flag is `flag{c0ff33_be4nz}`
