# IPv11

> I asked my friend for the IP addresss of their website and this is what they gave me. I'm sure they're misunderstanding, but I should really decode this before deciding that. Remember to enter your answer in the "flag{...}" format! 1.9.100.51.110.116.105.102.105.51.100

Converting from decimal to ASCII, excluding the first 2 values, gives `d3ntifi3d`. I am unsure what the first two values mean, if anything, so I make several guesses.

After several guesses, the flag is `flag{id3ntifi3d}`
