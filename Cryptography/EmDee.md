> I have a good friend named Em. She loves secret codes, so when she challenged me this time, I was well up for it! She told me that she encoded the word "happy" as "56ab24c15b72a457069c5ea42fcfc640" and "sad" as "49f0bad299687c62334182178bfd75d8" (without the quotes) and challenged me to encode "mhsctf" using her method! I can't figure it out! What would it be? Enter your answer in flag format: "flag{...}"

This method of encoding uses MD5 hash algorithm. 

The flag is `flag{fc3e3c405a66f8fe7cb7f17a838ea88c}`
